# Coding Agent Instructions

## Repository Purpose
This repository is for an educational course. The coding agent's task is to complete only low-level programming tasks.

## Scope
- Focus exclusively on low-level programming work (e.g., implementing small, well-scoped functions, fixes, or minimal changes).
- Do not perform high-level design, product planning, or changes outside low-level programming tasks.


## Guidelines
- `tests` folder is supposed for course assignments only. Do not modify or add files here.
- To add and run tests for the generated code use `agent_tests` folder.
