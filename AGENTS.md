# Coding Agent Instructions

## Repository Purpose
This repository is for an educational course. The coding agent's task is to complete only low-level programming tasks.

## Scope
- Focus exclusively on low-level programming work (e.g., implementing small, well-scoped functions, fixes, or minimal changes).
- Do not perform high-level design, product planning, or changes outside low-level programming tasks.
